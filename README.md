Global Thermonuclear War
========================

This is an implementation of Global Thermonuclear War using the Google Maps
JavaScript API. It doesn't do much yet. In fact I still haven't decided what I
even *want* it to do yet. Maybe a playable nuclear war game? Or maybe just a
sort of modern day re-imagining of
[the classic WarGames scene] [Learn, goddamnit]?

All I know right now is that I'm having a lot of fun messing around with this
code.
